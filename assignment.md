Objective:

 Develop a set of APIs for user registration, login, linking an ID, and implementing joins and chain delete functionality using Python and MongoDB.

 Requirements:

 1. Framework and Libraries:
 - Utilize FastAPI for the web framework.
 - Use PyMongo for interacting with MongoDB.

 2. API Endpoints:
 - Registration API: Endpoint to register a new user.
 - Login API: Endpoint to authenticate an existing user.
 - Linking ID API: Endpoint to link an ID to a user's account.
 - Joins: Implement functionality to join data from multiple collections.
 - Chain Delete: Implement functionality to delete a user and all associated data across collections.

 3. Database:
 - Use MongoDB to store user information.

 instructions:

 1. Setup FastAPI  and PyMongo:
 - Create a new FastAPI  application.
 - Configure PyMongo to connect to your MongoDB instance.

 2. Registration API:
 - Create an endpoint that allows users to register by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.
 - Ensure that passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database.

 3. Login API:
 - Create an endpoint that allows users to log in by verifying their credentials (email and password).
 - Implement appropriate error handling.

 4. Linking ID API:
 - Create an endpoint that allows users to link an ID to their account.
 - Ensure that the ID is stored securely and associated with the correct user.

 5. Joins:
 - Implement functionality to join data from multiple collections, enabling complex queries that involve multiple data sources.

 6. Chain Delete:
 - Implement functionality to delete a user and all associated data across collections, ensuring that all related records are properly removed.
